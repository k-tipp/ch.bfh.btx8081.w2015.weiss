CS Task 1: First Analysis

In your team, identify
    1.target users
    2.key features (from users' perspective)
    3.critical success factors
	   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_success_factor
Presentation of results: X2a 28.09.15, X2r 01.10.15
	5 min per team
	5 points for documents
	5 points for presentation


CS Task 2: SE Process

1.Decide whether your SE Process for implementing the MHC-PMS should be rather plan-driven or agile by collecting pros and cons, considering
	your findings from the first analysis
	your customer and your users
	your team and available time (resources)
	...
2.Based on your decison, design
	a process model with concrete activities
	for each activity, the goals, tasks, and potential output(s)
	the relation among outputs of different activities
	the required interaction with your stakeholders (= customer, users, management) and development team (= you) and required interaction
Presentation of results: X2a 28.09.15, X2r 01.10.15
	5 min per team
	10 points for documents, 5 points for presentation

CS Task 3: Design Thinking
	
1. Scoping
	- define: project scope, out of scope, and success measures
2. Research
	- investigate: literature, case studies, state of the art systems, ...
	- conduct: one interview and/or field study
3. Synthesize
	- collect, order, and analyze all material in your group
	- define: 2 or more personas as target user(s) for your application 
	- define: main features (i.e., user requirements)
4. Design
	- design storyboards
	- at least 2 storyboards per team member
	- discuss and iterate
	- make sure your storyboards are detailed enough to show the usage of a real system
5. Prototype
	- build 3 cardboard-based prototypes for your 3 most promising storyboards 
6. Validate
	- test your storyboards/prototypes with friends or family (i.e., outside this class)
	- first define your evaluation questions then how you will find the answer	

Aim for 3 iterations (start simple and then elaborate) 
	- your team needs to decide how to proceed
		- who does what, how to produce a joint result, next steps, ...
Presentation of final results: X2a 14.10., X2r 15.10.
	- 10 min per group incl. discussion
	- 5 points for the presentation
Documentation
 	- record results from each phase
		- take pictures of your non-digital material (storyboards, ...)
	- explain/justify your decisions
	- 20 points for your documented results
	
CS1 Task 6: External Perspective

1. Design a context model showing the boundary of your application and other external systems needed to implement your system requirements.

2. Design a high level activity diagram showing the interaction and thereby the interfaces with external systems. Use the notation of activity partitions to depict the responsibility of your system and external systems.
Submission of results: 29.10.15, 23:59

- 5 points for diagrams
- no presentation required
- but diagrams should be self-explaining

CS1 Task 7: Domain Model and Sequence Diagram

For your application, design:

1. a UML domain model (i.e. class diagrams) covering the main classes
- incl. association, inheritance, and aggregation relations
- observe the general modeling guidelines and make use of Responsibility
Driven Design (RDD) and use CRC-Cards as a tool.

2. based on your domain classes, create two UML sequence diagrams, one each for the following situations

- when the user updates some specific information
- when the system alerts the user about some specific event

3. if necessary, refine your UML domain model to include the attributes and
operations needed for your sequence diagrams.
Presentation of results (10 min per team): 09.11.15 (class a), 12.11.15 (class r)

10 points for documents 5 points for presentation
